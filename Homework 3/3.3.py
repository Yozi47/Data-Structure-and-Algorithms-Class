'''R-3.3 The number of operations executed by algorithms A and B is 40n2 and 2n3,
respectively. Determine n0 such that A is better than B for nâ‰¥n0.'''

"""Taking A and B from question then equating
    40n**2 = 2n**3  Dividing by 2
    20n**2 = n**3
    20 = n
    Hence, No = 20, since for all n>20, A will be faster than B"""
