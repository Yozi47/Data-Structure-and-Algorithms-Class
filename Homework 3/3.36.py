"""C-3.36 Describe an efficient algorithm for Ô¨Ånding the ten largest elements in
a sequence of size n. What is the running time of your algorithm? """

"""
1. Get the list of elements let it be A
2. find the largest element among the elements
3. add largest element in new list
4. remove the largest element from the previous list
5. repeat the process for 10 times
6. get the new list for 10 largest elements

The algorithms doesnt have the running time
