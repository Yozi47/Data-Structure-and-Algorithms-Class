According to the question initially the stack S is empty
A push() operation is carried out which means there are total of 25 elements into stack S
After that, top() operation is carried out for 12 times which returns top elements of stack S for 12 times
Then, pop() operation is carried out for 10 times but 3 of it raise Empty error
That means 3 times is taken out of 10 times of pop() operation resulting 7 times of pop() operation
Finally, 7 popped element is removed from 25 pushed elements resulting 18 remaining in the stack
So, The current size of S is 18.
